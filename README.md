# README

This is my Rails 7 project for studying:

* Ruby version 3.2.2;

* Rails version 7.1.2;

* Database sqlite3;

* View framework tailwind;

* Start the server with `./bin/dev` to start both the Tailwind watch process and the rails server;

## To-Do list

* Change the database to the latest postgresql version;
* Implement Devise, OmniAuth and Pundit for the app security;
* Create a layout to stick with for the remaining of this project.
* ...

## Things to study

* Learn how to push to production a Rails project;
* Learn how to use Tailwind;
* Learn how the asset pipeline truly works;
* Learn more in-depth about associations in models beyond `has_many` and `belongs_to`;
* study more about Redis and see if it can be useful for this project;
* ...

## Future ideas

* Choose either AWS or Heroku for deploy;
* Populate heavily the DB with either `seeds.db` or a script using the Faker gem;
* Make it similar to Reddit, with "hot topics", notifications, watch system, user created forums etc..;
* ~~Update the Ruby version to 3.2.2, RVM doesn't support it so i need to find another way of doing it~~;
* ...
